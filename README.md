# Nufochild

This is the Nochild project repository of children's daily nutrition fulfillment application.

Some of the program code may contain code from other people's existing projects / repositories, so here are the projects or repositories that I use in my application design:

1. [DialogYT](https://github.com/MatthiasKerat/DialogYT)
2. [CircularProgressIndicatorYT](https://github.com/MatthiasKerat/CircularProgressIndicatorYT)
